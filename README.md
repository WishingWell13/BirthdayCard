# ðŸ’Œ Shareable Digital Birthday Card

## About The Project

This application lets you create a unique, shareable digital birthday card for friends and family. Each card has its own link, allowing guests to leave heartfelt messages for the recipient. The recipient enjoys a beautiful, interactive experience with all the messages collected in one place.

## Key Features

- **Unique, shareable link generation for each card**
- **Scheduled delivery using Vercel Cron Jobs**
- **Guest flow for leaving new messages**
- **Intelligent name recognition for returning users to edit their messages**
- **A dedicated, clean view for the recipient to see all messages**
- **Dual viewing modes for the recipient: a standard list and an interactive "floating bubble" display**

## Built With

- [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
- [React & TypeScript](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

## User Flows

### The Card Creator
- Visits the homepage to create a new card.
- Fills in the recipient's name, date of birth, and schedules a delivery time.
- Upon submission, is redirected to a dedicated link-sharing page.
- This page provides two distinct links: one to share with guests (`/[cardId]`) and a direct link for the recipient to view the final card (`/card/[cardId]`).

### The Guest (Leaving a Message)
- Navigates to the guest link (`/[cardId]`).
- Is prompted to enter their name.
- If they are a new user, they are shown a form to write and submit their message.
- If the system recognizes their name, they are shown their previously submitted message(s) with an option to edit them.

### The Recipient (Viewing the Card)
- Navigates to the direct view link (`/card/[cardId]`), likely shared by the creator.
- Sees a clean display of all the messages left for them.
- Can use a toggle in the upper-right corner to switch between the default "Bubble View" and a "List View".
